<h1>About</h1>
<p>We are <a href="http://judytuna.com">Judy</a> and <a href="http://2-complex.com">Peterson</a> and we're learning Rails. This is a project we are developing that will hopefully become an annual POVRay shortcode contest. We are inspired by <a href="http://paulbourke.net/exhibition/%22">Paul Bourke</a>'s series of <a href="http://paulbourke.net/exhibition/scc5/">contests</a>, which were <a href="http://paulbourke.net/exhibition/scc5/final.html">last run in 2008</a> (and you can see Peterson's faucet movie there!) </p>

<h1>About The Tutorial I'm Using</h1>
<p>
  <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.
